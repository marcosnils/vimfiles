Vim
===


It is recommended that you use gVim in either Windows or Linux and MacVim for
Mac. Download from:

* (Windows) [http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc) (gvim73.exe)
* (Mac) [http://code.google.com/p/macvim/](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) (snapshot-64)

Usage
-----

Troubleshoot: Because of the large amount of submodules, if you ever have any
trouble after pulling from the repository, it will be easier to just back up 
your old .vim folder and just git clone a new version.

Clone this repo into your home directory either as `.vim` (linux/mac) or 
`vimfiles` (Windows). Such as:

    git clone git://github.com/marcosnils/vimfiles.git ~/.vim

Then `cd` into the repo and run this to get the submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Now just copy (or symlink) the `.vim/vimrc` file as `.vimrc` (Mac/Linux)
or copy as `_vimrc` (Windows) in your home directory. In Mac and Linux, the 
easiest thing to do is:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

On windows, create an environment var `gVim` pointing to the install dir and put
the` _vimrc` file in this dir. Clone the vimfiles repo into the same place like:

    c:/apps/vim/_vimrc
               /vim72/...
               /vimfiles/...

If you already have a custom `.vimrc` file, append the following lines to
load everything else along with your personal hacks:

    source ~/.vim/vimrc      "linux
    source ~/vimfiles/vimrc  "windows

To update all submodules, use the following command on vimfiles dir:

    git submodule foreach git pull origin master


If you are using MacVim on MacOS Lion, disable the native fullscreen mode to allow "WriteRoom" mode:

    defaults write org.vim.MacVim MMNativeFullScreen

Don't forget to install the font you plan to use from the `Fonts` dir. You can check the one that is enabled(uncommented) on the `set guifont` setting in the `vimrc` file.

Dependencies
------------

You will need these dependencies figured out:

* Exuberant Ctags [http://ctags.sourceforge.net/](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/)

In Ubuntu, for example, you will have to do:
    `apt-get install exuberant-ctags ncurses-term`

In OS X, you can install ctags with homebrew
    `brew install ctags`

On Windows you have to download Ctags and add ctags.exe in your PATH.

Mac OS X and most Linux distros come with Ruby already. If you're in Windows
look for Luis Lavena's latest Ruby Installer on [http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/)
